# Beauty Shop — Simple Static Site

This repository contains a small static website for a mock cosmetics store called "Beauty Shop". It was created as a midterm/web assignment and demonstrates a basic multi-page layout built with HTML and CSS.

## Topic

Beauty Shop is a fictional online storefront showcasing a small catalog of beauty products (foundation, lipstick, moisturizer). The site focuses on structure and styling rather than backend functionality.

## Features Implemented

- Multi-page navigation (Home, Products, About, Contact, Cart)
- Responsive product cards grid using CSS Grid
- Hero section with a call-to-action button
- Simple contact and about pages
- Basic cart page layout (static)
- Overall site styling with a centralized `style.css`

## Files

- `index.html` — Home page with product cards and hero section
- `products.html` — Product listing page (static)
- `about.html` — About page
- `contact.html` — Contact page with a form layout
- `cart.html` — Cart layout page
- `style.css` — Central stylesheet for the site
- `README.md` — This file

## How to preview locally

1. Open the project folder in your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or right-click → Open with → your browser) to view the site in your browser.

Or from PowerShell:

```powershell
start 'c:\Users\Laura\Desktop\Midterm_web\index.html'
```

## Notes and next steps

- The site is static and does not include any JavaScript for interactivity or a working cart backend.
- Possible improvements: add a per-product "Bestseller" badge, implement client-side cart functionality, or convert to a template-driven site.

If you'd like, I can add a stylized bestseller sticker (per your earlier idea), implement a small client-side cart, or make accessibility improvements.
